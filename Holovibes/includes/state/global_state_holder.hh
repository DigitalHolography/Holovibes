/*! \class GSH
 *
 * \brief The GSH (global state holder), is where all the global state of the program is stored.
 *
 * Its goal is to register changes commanded by the API (which comes from user events), dispatch the changes
 * to each worker, and provide informations queried by the API. It relies on several structures and mecanisms :
 *
 * Queries and Commands : every data needed by the API shall be obtained in the form of structured Queries, provided by
 * the GSH. This guarantees that only needed data is accessed to, and grants better code readability.
 * The same principle is applied to changes comming from the API, which come in the form of structured Commands.
 *
 * MicroCache : local state holder belonging to each worker. Previously, each worker had to fetch data at the same
 * place ; therefore, all variables had to be atomic, with the aim to be thread safe. In order to avoid that, each
 * worker now possess MicroCaches, containing all the state they need. Those MicroCaches are accessed only by their
 * worker, and are synchronized with the GSH when each worker chooses to (using a trigger system).
 * More informations and explanations concerning their synchronization with the GSH are provided in files micro-cache.hh
 * and micro-cache.hxx.
 *
 * FastUpdateHolder : the fastUpdateHolder is a templated map which is used by the informationWorker to access and
 * display information (like fps and queue occupancy) at a high rate, since this needs to be updated continuously.
