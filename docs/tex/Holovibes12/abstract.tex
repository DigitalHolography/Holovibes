Real-time digital hologram rendering from high bit-rate image streams of optically-acquired interferograms requires transformations that can take advantage of the parallel computing architectures of a graphics processing unit (GPU). The need to avoid any frame drop to ensure the integrity of an uninterrupted high throughput data stream in combination with real-time image rendering is technically challenging. Digital hologram rendering relies on spatial and temporal signal demodulation operations applied to the digitised interferogram stream. These demodulations consist of spatio-temporal Fourier analysis, convolutions, and principal component analysis. We describe a series of optimisation methods aimed at reducing the processing time and sustain high input frame throughput. We demonstrate real-time hologram rendering from an input stream of 8-bit, 256-by-256-pixel interferograms at a rate of 60,000 frames per second.
