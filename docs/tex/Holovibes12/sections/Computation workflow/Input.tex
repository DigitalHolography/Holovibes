The input queue is a "ring" memory structure located on the GPU. It aims to act as a staging area between the raw image stream from the camera, at a throughput determined by the frame grabber and the computation pipeline. It is a thread-safe producer/consumer queue as one thread only writes data to it while another only reads data from it. The input queue is the most critical component of the program because it is the entry point of all frames and it is being accessed by two threads simultaneously. % explain ring buffer
