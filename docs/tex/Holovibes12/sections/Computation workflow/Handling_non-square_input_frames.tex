Previously, non-square input images were padded with zeros so that the width matches the height of the frame. Therefore, rectangular images were handled similarly to square images to simplify computations. However, this naive approach has two disadvantages that limit the input throughput. Firstly, padding the input data is costly and memory intensive. Secondly, some parts of the input were irrelevant but were still being processed by our computation pipeline. Therefore, we adapted all operations performed on images and memory transfers to support non-square inputs. This change led to a substantial improvement in the processing time and the input throughput as using rectangular images is frequent in our setup.
