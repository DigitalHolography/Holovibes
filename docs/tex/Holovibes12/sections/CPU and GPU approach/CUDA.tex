\href{https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit}{CUDA} (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. It is specifically designed for enabling general-purpose computation on NVIDIA GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). CUDA allows developers to harness the massive parallel processing power of GPUs to accelerate a wide range of computing tasks beyond traditional graphics rendering. \\

In the context of your ophthalmology software, CUDA can be seamlessly integrated to significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of complex calculations and data processing. By incorporating CUDA into your ophthalmology software, we can unlock the full potential of modern GPU hardware, allowing for faster, more accurate, and more efficient analysis of medical imaging data, ultimately benefiting developer comfort, software maintainability and practical performance. \\

Holovibes uses the CUDA Fast Fourier Transform (cuFFT), Basic Linear Algebra Subroutine (cuBLAS) libraries and CUDA General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) SVD, PCA \textbf{unclear anagrams}.\\

% wtf are SVD and PCA ? I beg you to be explicit
