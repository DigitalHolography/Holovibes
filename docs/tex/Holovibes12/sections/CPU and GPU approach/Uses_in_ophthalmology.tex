In ophthalmology, GPUs prove valuable for processing large quantities of medical images in real time.\\

In Holovibes, we employ these components alongside high-throughput cameras to perform complex calculations swiftly and efficiently. Leveraging the GPU's parallel processing capabilities, which surpass those of the CPU, is essential for this task. It's worth noting that GPUs typically have more limited memory compared to CPUs. Consequently, we rely on CPU buffers to temporarily store and manage data before processing, ensuring the seamless and efficient execution of ophthalmology's calculations.
