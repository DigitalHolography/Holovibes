A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialised electronic circuit designed to accelerate the rendering of images and videos. Originally developed for rendering graphics in video games and other multimedia applications, GPUs have evolved into highly parallel processing units capable of performing many mathematical calculations simultaneously. This parallelism makes GPUs well-suited for tasks involving large-scale mathematical computations, such as scientific simulations, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Modern GPUs often have thousands of cores optimised for parallel processing.\\
