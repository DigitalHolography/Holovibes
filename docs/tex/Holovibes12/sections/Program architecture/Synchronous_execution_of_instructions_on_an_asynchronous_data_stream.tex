The end-to-end buffer system allows to perform all the operations in the pipeline required for image rendering synchronously. Memory transfers are done from and to buffers that are not subject to access via interruptions. The set of image processing functions is run repeatedly and changes upon user request. They are applied when the GPU has finished the previous set of computations in the pipeline. The asynchronous stream of input and output frames, whose availability is notified via interruptions, is stacked in parallel by independent threads into dedicated input and output queues. Computations run asynchronously with respect to input (the data stream from the camera does not stop) and output (image display and recording operate randomly).
