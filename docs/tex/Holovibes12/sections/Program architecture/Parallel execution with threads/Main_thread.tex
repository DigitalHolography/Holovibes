The main program thread handles the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or the Command-Line Interface (CLI) mode when GUI is disabled. The main window provides widgets to configure all settings related to the software and a separate window shows frames from the GPU output queue for real-time visualisation. Other windows can be opened to visualise additional information, such as raw input frames or the phase convolution kernel used for wave propagation.
