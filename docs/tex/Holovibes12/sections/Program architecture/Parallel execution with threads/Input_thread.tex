The input thread is responsible for streaming raw images from the data source to the input queue. Images captured from a camera or a file are copied from the CPU memory to the GPU memory into the input queue. For input files smaller than the available GPU memory, the entire data set content can be copied directly into GPU device to avoid useless memory transfers and improve image rendering throughput.
