Holovibes is divided into three parts : backend containing the GSH (Global state Holder), api and frontend through GUI(Graphic User Interface) and CLI(Command Line)
This allows a clear separation of code and logic. Moreover, the exportation of the API and backend is easy.

A cache is a high-speed data storage layer that stores a  subset of usually transient data. Future requests are thus processed as quickly as possible by accessing the primary data storage location. This process is used in Holovibes to limit the memory cost during copying and improve execution speed.
