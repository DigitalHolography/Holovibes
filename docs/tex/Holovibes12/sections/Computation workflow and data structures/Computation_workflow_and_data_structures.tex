In this report, we choose to focus on the implementation details rather than diving into the details of hologram rendering. The basic computation workflow is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:computation_workflow}. Our data structures were created to meet two key requirements: (1) avoid any frame drop in the continuous stream of input images ; (2) enable more efficient parallelization of the computations used for image rendering. To this effect, we make extensive use of buffers (fixed size contiguous memory area) and queues (ring buffer: fixed-size buffer connected end-to-end) that are allocated in the GPU memory. These structures are designed to be manipulated in a thread-safe fashion without causing a race condition (when the program's behavior is determined by uncontrollable events such as thread execution order).
