To improve both the processing time and the input throughput, we have to use the full potential of the GPU by maximising its workload. We noticed that some operations were not using all the Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) of the GPU. To alleviate this issue, we introduced different CUDA streams to execute more operations in parallel by exploiting all the SMs. In particular, it allows to perform computations and memory transfers in parallel as cells performing computations are different from cells handling data transfers. As opposed to previously, where all instructions were issued on the default stream, this change led to a significant performance improvement.
