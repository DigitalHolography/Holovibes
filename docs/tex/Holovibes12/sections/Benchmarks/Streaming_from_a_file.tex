On Table \ref{tab:results_2}, we report the performance comparison when reading 16-bit 1024$\times$1024 pixel frames from a file. By having a steady input stream and a fixed input data size, we can compare the output throughput between the two versions. We can notice that the introduction of our software optimisations allow the processing of 1,000 frames per second compared to 100 previously, without any frame drop. As a result, the output throughput increases from 3.22 GV/s to 30.06 GV/s which represents approximately a 10$\times$ improvement.
