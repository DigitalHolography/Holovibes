    \caption{Diagram of the general computation workflow for high-speed rendering of digital holograms. The input frames (8 or 16-bit unsigned integer-valued images). Space and time transformations are applied sequentially to batches of frames to produce demodulated, complex-valued (one 32-bit single float per quadrature) holograms, which are flattened to a real-valued reconstructed image (one single float per pixel). The continuous stream of input and output frames is buffered to prevent any frame drop.
