# To-Do

## Old bugs???

* Marshall.cxx / ole32.dll : No known fixes, try updating QT.
* Camera not recognized in holovibes : Make sure your versions of .dll and .lib files are updated.
* If the holograms do not work for a reason, try checking what gpu architecture you are compiling on (20, 30, 35...).
